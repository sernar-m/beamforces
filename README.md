# beamforces
Small UI that calculates forces on a beam and displays it accordingly

The programm is really not that long so its almost self explainatory.
I will try to add and improve it though as its a very basic yet important calculation.
Personally i intend to use it as a mean to not forget this and a quick way to get back in. Obviously i hope someone out there can use it too.
